hello. I've been studying Mock, Spy in Test double and I'm getting confused, so I've put together a personal summary.

All example code is on a [Github](https://github.com/Voyager003/blog-code/tree/main/testdouble).

## Test double

First, let's talk about test doubles before the example. description follow this [Xunit pattern](http://xunitpatterns.com/Test%20Double.html).

> Sometimes it is just plain hard to test the system under test (SUT) because it depends on other components that cannot be used in the test environment.
> ...
> When we are writing a test in which we cannot (or chose not to) use a real depended-on component (DOC), we can replace it with a Test Double. The Test Double doesn't have to behave exactly like the real DOC;
> it merely has to provide the same API as the real one so that the SUT thinks it is the real one!

To summarize it in one line, we can say that it's software that creates objects that satisfy dependencies without relying on production code.

There are five types of test doubles, but we'll only focus on the ones you need to understand.

### Stub

> It replaces real objects with test-specific objects that support the desired indirect inputs to the system under test.

**Stub** are a way to provide canned responses to things that are called during testing.

Let's see at the code rather than explain it.

#### How to work with Stubs in Mockito

##### Ongoing Stubbing

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62d25eea-ed9a-4e42-9de3-c4365c93d416" />


`Ongoing Stubbing` is a method that specifies the method to be stubbed in the when method and defines the return value. This is written in the form of a method chaining.

```java
when(reservatinoService.createReservation()).thenReturn(product);
```
In these case, method to stub would be reservatinoService.createReservation(), and the code to define that product is returned after the call to the stubbed method.

For then, you can have it not only return an object, but also throw an exception (thenThrow) and call the real method (thenCallRealMethod).

##### Stubber

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ba556c8-abef-4567-bd18-e0ac636a2ec7" />

`Stubber` inherits from BaseStubber, specifies the class to stub in the when clause, and calls the method.

```java
OrderService orderService = Mockito.mock(OrderService.class);

Mockito.doReturn("DELIVERED").when(orderService).getOrderStatus(1L);

String status = orderService.getOrderStatus(1L);

assertEquals("DELIVERED", status);
```

In these case, we've defined the stub to return “DELIVERED” when getOrderStatus receives 1L.

As with ongoing stubbing, we also support methods that throw exceptions or call the actual method.

### Mock & Spy

#### Mock

The key of `Mock` is to mimic the behavior in the way it is intended.

All methods on the Mock object do nothing by default, returning values only by predefined stubbing.


```java
// Mock generate
BookService mockBookService = Mockito.mock(BookService.class);

// return by Stubbing
when(mockBookService.findBook("Java")).thenReturn(new Book("Java Programming"));
```
#### Spy

The `Spy` is created based on a real object and calls the real methods on the object.

However, we can specify the return value by stubbing to the method we need.

```java
// BookService
public class BookService {
    public Book findBook(String title) {
        return new Book(title);
    }
}

BookService realBookService = new BookService();

BookService spyBookService = Mockito.spy(realBookService);

// Stubbing specitfic method
when(spyBookService.findBook("Java")).thenReturn(new Book("Mocked Book"));

// 1. call none Stubbing method
Book bookPython = spyBookService.findBook("Python");
assertEquals("Python", bookPython.getTitle()); // 실제 title이 "Python"이어야 함

// 2. call Stubbing method
Book bookJava = spyBookService.findBook("Java");
assertEquals("Mocked Book", bookJava.getTitle()); // title이 "Mocked Book"이어야 함
    }
}
```

we can use these attributes to test **some of the behavior of an object, while reserving the rest of the methods for when you actually need to execute it**.

## Example

The example is a book rental system, and the overall flow is as follows

1. inquiry the user
2. inquiry a book
3. check book availability
4. create and store the rental information

A simplified implementation of the domain entities and service code required in the code looks like this.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12fa2483-fbdf-4e1c-90a1-81db83debd99" />

Here is service code.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6343587e-f078-4adc-9143-320c25860dba" />

Then write Service test code.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/824efed4-c124-4b8f-a05b-f70c28efeaa7" />

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1281a27-31a5-4c9f-a8e9-b9de868bd8be" />

### Issue

Test is successful, but it has some issues.

The given section creates a fixture for creating domain entities, followed by saving them to the DataBase. Although not included in the example, if it is similar to a production environment, it will also be preceded by settings related to the DataBase.

The concerns of createReservation are

1. throwing an exception if the user and book are not found
2. validate the availability of the book
3. make sure the reservation object is created and saved
4. changed the book's availability status
5. return the reservation ID

but there is too much surrounding code declared in the given clause, which means that the “concern” of the test is off.

So what kind of context do we need to set up to make the test fit the concern?

1. throw exception if user and book are not found -> return empty Optional when calling findById with non-existent memberId, bookId
2. check if the book is available -> set the status of the retrieved Book object to AvailabilityStatus.RESERVED
3. verify that the booking object is created and saved -> changeAvailability(AvailabilityStatus.RESERVED) is called

etc... we probably need to set up situations like the above, but it's too cumbersome to set them up in advance and then re-set them every time we run the test.

Let's use a test double to isolate our code.

## Using Mock

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1d318b4-bd49-4da2-a0c3-70539ad7d337" />

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/722d61db-f9eb-46a1-8f0b-c18cbb6163d8" />

Unlike the first integration test I wrote that brought up a spring context, this one

1. instead of creating a real repository to resolve dependencies, we created a mock object to resolve dependencies
2. wrote expectation behaviors (when, thenReturn) to create the desired expectation situation in the test and stubbed it (stub)
3. verify the behavior (verify).

At this point, you can see that the @InjectMocks annotation is specified in the Service code, which will automatically create instances for the fields specified by the annotation and find and inject the fields specified by @Mock, @Spy, if any.

## Using Spy

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29bb7827-02c2-4db9-b9b2-15c7b8795abb" />

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df69a04d-34a5-4815-a911-caa33dd50f30" />

Let's say your test encounters a scenario where you borrow a book and then don't change the borrow status (the book's changeAvailability method).

As we saw above, Spy can handle this.

We declared the Book object as a spy object and then stubbed it so that when the changeAvailability method is called, it does nothing.

The original behavior should have changed the status to RESERVED if a rental status change was attempted, but since it didn't behave as specified by the stubbing, we could see that it was still AVAILABLE when changeAvailability was called.

This is how you can make your test environment predictable by stubbing only partially based on real objects.

## Closing

I've always been of the mindset that testing with mocks doesn't guarantee that the functionality will work in production if the test is successful.

So I've deliberately avoided using mocks, but writing this article has been a good time to think about how to write efficient tests and how to use test doubles to isolate tests.

There are a lot of opinions on testing methodologies, so I think I need to see more situations to solidify my thoughts.

Thanks for reading, and if you can point out any misinformation, I'll take it on board.
